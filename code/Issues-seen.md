Awesome! It‚Äôs running smoothly now. üéâ

### üõ†Ô∏è The Issue in the Logs:
The error was caused by the Beam YAML pipeline trying to locate the Java executable using the `which` command (which is Unix-based) when running on Windows. Since the `which` command doesn‚Äôt exist on Windows, it threw a `FileNotFoundError`, making the process fail.

### üîß What We Did:
We modified the `available` method in `yaml_provider.py` to account for this OS difference:
- We used `platform.system()` to check if the system is Windows or not.
- On Windows, we replaced `which` with the Windows-specific command `where` to locate the `java` executable.
- Now, the pipeline can find Java, and the error was avoided.

### ‚úÖ Result:
With this fix in place, the pipeline ran correctly, and you saw the expected log outputs like:

```
INFO:root:{"element": 1}
INFO:root:{"element": 2}
INFO:root:{"element": 3}
```

This means that your pipeline is successfully executing and passing data through the defined transforms. The log output is what you'd expect from a simple pipeline with a `Create` transform (which creates data) and a `LogForTesting` (which logs the elements).
